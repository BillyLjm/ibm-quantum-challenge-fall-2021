## Description  
The challenge consisted of 4 challenges, in each `challenge-x` folder.  
Each folder has a `index.md` introduction, a `.ipynb` workbook, and a `.html` copy of the workbook.  
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to finish the extra exercise 4c, but sections of my implementation do give correct outputs. Maybe I'll revisit it in the future.
